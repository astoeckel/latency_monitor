# latency_monitor

Python webservice monitorying latency accross a set of SSH connections. This was a quick-and-dirty afternoon hack.

This code has no dependencies apart from `ssh` being installed as an external application. Simply run
```sh
./latency_monitor.py localhost
```
instead of localhost, you can specify any host onto which you can log in using SSH (assuming you are using public/private key authentication). For example
```sh
./latency_monitory.py user@host1 "user@host2 -p 2222"
```
